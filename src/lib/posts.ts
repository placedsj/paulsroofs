                <p class="lead">Metal roofs are renowned for their exceptional durability and longevity, making them a superior choice for homeowners seeking a long-term solution. Unlike traditional asphalt shingles that typically require replacement every 15 to 25 years, a high-quality metal roof can protect your home for <strong>50 years or more</strong>.</p>

                <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
                    <li><strong>Material Quality:</strong> We use high-gauge steel and aluminum panels that are coated with advanced finishes like Kynar 500Â® to resist fading, chalking, and rust.</li>
                    <li><strong>Expert Installation:</strong> A roof\'s lifespan is only as good as its installation. Our certified team ensures every panel is fastened securely and waterproofed to withstand New Brunswick\'s harsh weather.</li>
                    <li><strong>Low Maintenance:</strong> Metal roofs are practically maintenance-free. They don\'t support the growth of moss or algae and naturally shed snow and ice.</li>
                </ul>
